# authorization_endpoint - The authorization endpoint to which a client will redirect the user to authenticate.
# token_endpoint - The token endpoint the client will call to request an access token.
# jwks_uri - The key set endpoint a resource server will call to get the public keys it can use to validate tokens.
# introspection_endpoint - The introspection endpoint a resource server can call to validate opaque tokens.

# response_type – this request parameter specifies to the authorization server that
# the client wants to use the authorization code grant type. Remember that a client might
# have configured multiple grant types. It needs to tell the authorization server which
# grant type it wants to use.
# client_id – the client identifier is like the “username” for the user. It uniquily
# identifies the client in the system.
# scope – Specifies which scope the client wants to be granted with this authentication attempt.
# redirect_uri – Specifies the URI to which the authorization server will redirect after a successful authentication. This URI must be
# one of those previously configured for the current client.
# code_challenge= - If using the authorization code enhanced with
# PKCE (discussed in chapter 13), you must provide the code challenge with the
# authorization request. When requesting the token, the client must send the verifier pair
# to prove they are the same application that initially sent this request. The PKCE flow is
# enabled by default.
# code_challenge_method – This request parameter specifies which is the hashing
# method that has been used to create the challenge from the verifier. In this case, S256
# means SHA-256 was used as a hash function.
